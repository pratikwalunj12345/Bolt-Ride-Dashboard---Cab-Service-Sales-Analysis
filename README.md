# Bolt-Ride-Dashboard---Cab-Service-Sales-Analysis
Bolt, a popular cab booking app, is widely used for ride-hailing services across cities. For my recent project, I worked with a Berlin, Germany dataset (from kaggle) to analyze key metrics and uncover insights about Bolt's operations. I performed data cleaning using Excel and analyzed data using SQL, and finally created dashboard on Power BI.
